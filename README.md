# Pinglet DB for Swoole

Pinglet database pool for Swoole, based on the wonderful [ipejasinovic/swoole-universal-pool](https://github.com/ipejasinovic/swoole-universal-pool).

You can find examples to use in /examples directory.

While it is tuned for Pinglet framework, it can be used in mostly all Swoole apps.
